# HFN-Mandi-Defect-detection-in-Fruit
  Problem Statement:
  Using Artificial Intelligence through computer vision and deep learning to automate fruit detection, sorting, and identification of 
  damaged ones, collect sufficient data from the internet to efficiently train the model that one builds
  
  Methodology:
•	Collected 2000+ pictures of each fruit that would cover the variety, both healthy and damaged ones included
•	70% of the dataset is divided into training the AI model, while the rest 30% for Cross-validation test
•	Selected a YOLOV5 (a heavily altered version of Darknet 53) model using Image-AI to train using our collected dataset  


  Deliverables:
•	Successfully created an AI model that can be used in fruit farming, production and packaging & providing better quality products to customers
•	Initiated model deployment on the Harvesting India website, obtained 82% accuracy on the test data set
•	Trained fruit detection model can successfully detect all the fruits in the image as well as identify the fruit with a defect (fruit with a spot)
